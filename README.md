# Face Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis Method
One of the simplest and most effective PCA approaches used
in face recognition systems is the so-called eigenface
approach. This approach transforms faces into a small set of
essential characteristics, eigenfaces, which are the main
components of the initial set of learning images (training set).
Recognition is done by projecting a new image in the
eigenface subspace, after which the person is classified by
comparing its position in eigenface space with the position of
known individuals . The advantage of this approach over
other face recognition systems is in its simplicity, speed and
insensitivity to small or gradual changes on the face. The
problem is limited to files that can be used to recognize the
face. Namely, the images must be vertical frontal views of
human faces.
